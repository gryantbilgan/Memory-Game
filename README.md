## [MEMORY KOMBAT](https://gryantbilgan.github.io/Memory-Game/)

### Description:

**_MEMORY KOMBAT_** is a fully functional web game that utilizes Javascript, HTML, and CSS to test how good your memory is. GET OVER HERE! The battle for the Cerebral Realm has begun. Players will have to use their cognitive and recall abilities to match the unique set of cards displayed before them. Delve into the pit and test your mind. I have nothing further to teach you. You possess the knowledge. All that is lacking now is the will...

When two cards have been clicked they will flip back over after .3 seconds. How good is your memory?


## Matches Made

 If two cards have been matched they will remain displayed, so you know how many cards you have left. Your score will increase the more matches you get, but if you guess incorrectly your number of guesses will decrease.


## End of Game

As soon as all of the matches have been made, the cards will disappear and you will be declared Victorious or Defeated. Do you dare to try again?
